```

### Install with [Pathogen](https://github.com/tpope/vim-pathogen)

## Contributing

If your language is not getting highlighted open an issue or a PR with the fix.
You only need to add a line to the `syntax/svelte.vim` file.

Don't forget to write [Vader](https://github.com/junegunn/vader.vim) tests for
the code you write. You can run the tests by executing `make test` in the
terminal.
